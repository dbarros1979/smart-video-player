# 🚀 Backend – Smart Video Player 🎥

Welcome to the backend of the *Smart Video Player*! Here’s where the magic begins, and we can’t wait to show you around.

## 📂 Folder Structure

In the backend, you’ll find the **videoservice** folder, which is dedicated to fetching and serving videos. This is the heart of our project, ensuring that all your video needs are met with precision and speed.

### 🎉 Current Features:
- **Video Retrieval**: Our API fetches videos from a variety of sources, ready to stream to your devices like a pro! 

### 🔮 Future Improvements:
We’re on a quest to enhance your experience even further! Soon, we’ll be implementing a **Recommendation System** that will analyze your viewing habits and suggest videos you’re likely to love. Imagine a personal assistant for your video needs!

### 🔧 Getting Started:
1. Navigate to the **videoservice** folder:
   ```bash
   cd videoservice
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the video service:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Thank you for being part of our journey! We’re excited to build a video experience that’s smarter, faster, and tailored just for you.
