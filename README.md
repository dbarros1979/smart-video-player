# 🎬 Smart Video Player 📱📺

Welcome to the *Smart Video Player* – the smart video experience you didn’t know you needed! Built to serve videos seamlessly across platforms, our project is on a mission to *blow your mind* (and your video streaming standards)!

This repository is organized into **backend** and **frontend** folders, each holding the magic for a truly unique experience.

## 🌐 Backend – The Brains Behind It All 🧠
In the backend, we have a *RESTless API* (yes, it works *tirelessly* for you!). This API does the heavy lifting, fetching all the videos you’ll ever want and more. Our ambition is to roll out a **Recommendation System** soon, so it’ll know what you want to watch *before you even know it*.

- **API Highlights**:
  - Fetch, stream, and serve videos like a boss! 📹
  - Recommendation system (*coming soon* 🚀) for a Netflix-like experience, minus the subscription.
  - Built to scale and keep your smart devices smart. 😉

## 🎨 Frontend – Where the Fun Comes Alive 🎉
The frontend is where we make the magic happen! The project includes:
- **Mobile App** – A video player designed for your phone that’s as sleek as it is powerful.
- **TV App** (coming soon) – Because great videos deserve the big screen treatment!

We’re all about making things *easy on the eyes*, *smooth on the fingers*, and *fun for the mind*. You’ll want to curl up with this player and never let it go.
